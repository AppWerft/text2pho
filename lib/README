GOAL
____

This software is made public in order to support the MBROLA project
with a free German Text-to-Phoneme conversion, which is essentially
the linguistic and prosodic part of the synthesis system Hadifix
(http://www.ikp.uni-bonn.de/~tpo/Hadifix.en.html).

Any bugs, mispronunciations and other comments should be emailed
to Thomas Portele (tpo@ikp.uni-bonn.de). I will supply frequent
updates of the lexica as bugfixes.

======================================================================

DISTRIBUTION:
_____________

This distribution contains the executables txt2pho and pipefilt,
two file sets with prosodic information for male and female voices (*.int,
*.dur, *.prt, *.amp), and the lexica (hadifix.sce, hadifix.scf, hadifix.scr),
a few demo files (*.txt) and this file.

It requires the MBROLA synthesizer with at least one German database,
obtainable from

	http://tcts.fpms.ac.be/synthesis

This program is tested only tentatively - it is likely that certain
phoneme combinations are not supported by the current German voices.
In this case, let me know, and I will try to fix it.

======================================================================

INSTALLATION AND USAGE:
_______________________

After the extraction of the file txt2pho.tgz a subdirectory
txt2pho_data with all files necessary to run txt2pho is created.
It should remain located as a subdirectory to the dircetory of
the executable (OK, this is not very elegant...).

txt2pho currently supports only one option. If a male voice
is used, the appropriate command is 'txt2pho m'. Thr program
reads text from stdin and writes the MBROLA commands to stdout.
In its current version every NEWLINE is treated as a marker
for sentence finality. When synthesizing continuous text this
will lead to unwanted breaks in an utterance. The program
pipefilt should correct this fault in a very simple fashion:
it inserts a NEWLINE after every '.:;!?', followed by a whitespace,
and changes all other NEWLINEs into blanks. There are of course
much better and application-oriented methods for this.

In its current stage txt2pho does no preprocessing. It does not
read numbers (if not written out), symbols etc.

German ä can be entered as ä, "a, or ae (but that's not
unambiguous). TeX notation is safe.


======================================================================

WHAT DOES IT DO, AND HOW:
_________________________

The conversion from graphemes to phonemes is done using a lexicon
with more than 50000 entries and flexion tables. The system tries
to find compound words (which does sometimes leads to interesting
results). A description of the linguistic processing is given
in (Portele & Kraemer, 1995 - ftp://ftp.asl1.ikp.uni-bonn.de/pub/
vm41/tpwolf95.ps.gz - in German). During this process word classes
are derived which are converted to prominence values (Widera, Portele
& Wolters, 1997 - not yet on the Internet). These parameters drive
a prominence-based synthesis system (Portele & Heuft, 1996 -
ftp://asl1.ikp.uni-bonn.de/pub/vm41/tpspeak2.ps.gz). A decision
tree (*.prt) converts the prominence values into prosodic parameters
(Heuft & Portele, 1996 - ftp://asl1.ikp.uni-bonn.de/pub/vm41/bhics962.ps.gz).
Here, speaker dependent parameters (*.int for f0, *.dur for duration)
are used.

======================================================================

MANIPULATIONS:
______________

Manipulations at the lexicon files are not allowed. Manipulations
of the decision tree is possible but dangerous. In the files *.dur
the first parameter denotes the default speaking rate. In the files
*.int pitch height is controlled, and these numbers can be adapted
to personal needs.

A number of control sequences can be included (Portele, 1996, -
ftp://asl1.ikp.uni-bonn.de/pub/vm41/tpdaga962.ps.gz) 
in the orthographic input when placed between braces. A space
character may not appear in a command. Commands must be separated
from other words or commands by a space character.
Commands contain a keyword followed by a colon and the command
parameters. Among the commands are 

Voice 

The command value is the name of the inventory to be used from now
on. Its files must be in the directory of the current inventory.
However, this only changes the prosodic output and has no effect
on the MBROLA synthesizer. Possible names are "male" and "female". 

Duration 

accepts positive and negative values. The speech rate is changed accordingly. 

Pitch 

accepts positive and negative values in Hz. The average pitch changes accordingly. 

Pause 

inserts a pause. The command parameter specifies the length in milliseconds. 

WordProminence 

controls the prominence of the following word and can be set between 0 (not prominent) and 31 (very prominent). 

WordRhythm 

modifies the rhythm of a word. For each syllable one of the characters _ 
(not accented), ' (primary accent), ,(secondary accent) must appear in
the command parameter string. 

Transcription 

gives the transcription for the following word. Syllable boundaries
must be indicated by a | and the transcription must be in SAMPA .
Primary ' and secondary , accent marks can be included after the syllable boundary sign. 

Accent 

mimics in a very crude way some local varieties of Standard German. Up
to now, only Rheinisch is a valid parameter. 

Singing 

allows the synthesis of a song. For every syllable the length and 
the value of the pertinent note must be specified.
The length may be one of 4 , 8 , 16 , whereby 16 is the shortest. 
The value can be one of c , cis , d , es ,
e , f , fis , g , as , a , b , h . If the value is followed by a
' it is assumed to be in the next octave.
Length and value are seperated by a comma, notes for different 
syllable by a semicolon. A command might
therefore look like: {Singing:8,f;8,g;4,e}. Multiple singing commands
can appear in one utterance. 

SetSingingTempo 

defines the tempo of the song from now on. Valid parameter values are 
a number for beats per minute or one of the following strings: 
Largo , Larghetto , Adagio , Andante , Alegretto , Allegro , Presto . 

SetOctave 

defines the heigth of the singing voice. Valid parameters are C , c , 
c' , c'' , c''' . 

Examples can be found in the files with the extension .txt in
the txt2pho_data directory


======================================================================

PROBLEMS:
_________

- Because txt2pho was made for a more complex inventory than diphones
  where every phoneme combination is synthesizable the system
  might demand combinations not in the inventory. 
  Currently I have no idea how to solve this. The most
  straightforward way would be a file containing all
  impossible combinations. But then I would have to substitute
  one of the two sounds - but which one, and with what??
  I hope the next version will contain a solution. 

- Some reductions inherent in the original inventory cannot
  be synthesized adequately with the diphone databases, and
  the speech may sometimes sound overaticulated (e.g. non-syllablic
  vowels in "Bosnien" or syllabic consonants in "haben").

- It is nearly untested :-(

- A few words are wrongly accented
